                        I have been passionate about video games for as long as I can remember.
                        I loved the way they supported me in the most difficult moments of my life,
                        to keep fighting against the obstacles. To be determined and not let myself fall in failure.
                        That is why my dream is to become a great video game developer and designer.
                        To bring to people the same support that my heroes gave me when I was down and tempted to surrender.

                        -2016 The Grind-
                        <br /> <br />
                        I started making games as a child but the real journey began when I started studying at the
                        Los Andes University, the first challenge.The university was the one of the best in my country, ranked 8th in latin america.
                        With the help of a scholarship the dream was possible, but the challenge that came with it too. I had to challenge myself and
                        my limits in the process to make the dream came true. In the process I developed a few prototypes and learned the basics.
                        Through my journey at the University, I met amazing people that share the same interest as I. This helped me to
                        motivate myself even more, to belive it was possible.

                        <br /> <br />
                        -2020 The First One-
                        <br /> <br />

                        Graduated from the university. Recive my bachelor degree and started looking for jobs. I did not know how
                        Colombia's landscape in the videogame industry was at the time. I though it was pretty niche and that
                        getting the first job was going to be a process that I had to be patient and persistent with. I applied to my
                        first batch of jobs and let them sink while I maked some prototypes. The next week the call arrived,
                        the company, GETA Club. The asked for my background and my knowledges and set me with a technical interview.
                        The process was blazing fast, and I got my first videogame developer job. The feeling was amazing and the pay
                        was much more that I expected. This job teach me multiple concepts and set the ground for what I aspire to be
                        in the future. I met amazing and talented people at this job, that taught me so many things that I am so grateful for.

                        -2022 Timba es una chimba-
                        <br /> <br />

                        After a year and a a couple of months it was time for me to start searching other opportunities. After some time, 
                        I arrived at Timba Games. A top game developer studio in colombia that had under his belt heavy projects and heavy personalities.
                        I met some of the people that I followed and that maked the game industry in Colombia possible. Met also incredible 
                        artist and developers, that are without a doubt some of the best in the Country. This past year has been paired with much 
                        more responsabilty and gain of knowledge developing some of the games that the company has. The company is so warm also and 
                        the games that they made have that warm impregnated in them. It has truly been an amazing experience working at the studio.
                        experience.
